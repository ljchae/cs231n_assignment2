When we input  data into fully connected affine layers, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"Flatten\" operation to collapse the C x H x W values per representation into a single long vector. The Flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

    "### Things you should try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 7x7; this makes pretty pictures but smaller filters may be more efficient\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and regularization strength. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these; however they would be good things to try for extra credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative update steps: For the assignment we implemented SGD+momentum, RMSprop, and Adam; you could try alternatives like AdaGrad or AdaDelta.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
